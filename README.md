# Moodlechain

A plugin developed for [Moodle LMS](https://moodle.com/solutions/lms/). Designed to further support universities to ensure integrity of grades and transparency of the grading process when managing grades in Moodle.

# Overview

This plugin works together with a private Blockchain where course managers can save grades and retrieve them to verify their integrity over time.

The moodlechain/ folder holds all the plugin files. This plugin belongs to the [Gradebook reports](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Gradebook_reports) type, can be installed through Moodle UI(Site administration>Plugins>Install plugin).
The contracts/ folder holds the smart contract we developed to work with the plugin.
